# Three.js TypeScript Boilerplate

> This boilerplate was created as a sub project of my [ThreeJS and TypeScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/threejs-tutorials/?referralCode=4C7E1DE91C3E42F69D0F) and is only just the beginning of what you will create.

When run, the boilerplate shows a green wireframe rotating cube, with OrbitControls included. 

[Example](https://sbcode.net/threejs/threejs-typescript-boilerplate/)

It is hosted using NodeJS and Express.

It contains server and client scripts both written in TypeScript.

The client typescript and compiled javascript both use [ES6 import syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)

2. While running `npm run dev`, any edits to the `client/client.ts` or `server/server.ts` you make will be auto recompiled and you should refresh your browser to see the changes.

See image showing compiled client side JavaScript using ES6 import syntax.
